# CEA Study Design & Milestones (Synthetic Prototype)

## Scenario

Benefits-eligibility IVR / chatbot that screens users for support and
provides a decision (eligible, ineligible, needs more documentation).

## Experimental factors (synthetic)

- Consent framing: brief vs. detailed vs. control.
- Explanation style: outcome-only vs. step-by-step rationale.
- Appeals path: buried link vs. clear "Talk to a human" option.

## Planned milestones

1. v1.0.0 – Upload concept paper PDF and basic repository skeleton.
2. v1.1.0 – Add synthetic interaction logs for the main scenario.
3. v1.2.0 – Add user-level panel + basic analysis script.
4. v1.3.0 – Add fairness / recourse indicators to synthetic data.
5. v1.4.0 – Add evaluation notebook for scenario-based metrics.
6. v1.5.0 – Freeze v1 artefact package (paper + code + synthetic data).
