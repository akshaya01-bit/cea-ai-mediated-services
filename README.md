# Consent, Explanation, and Appeals in AI-Mediated Services

This repository contains **synthetic** data, analysis scripts, and materials for the
concept paper:

> "Consent, Explanation, and Appeals in AI-Mediated Services: Designing for
> Understanding, Fairness, and Recourse" (Akshaya Jayasankar, 2025).

The goal is to prototype an **evidence-ready evaluation pipeline** for an
AI-mediated benefits-eligibility service, using only synthetic logs.

## Repository structure

- `docs/` – PDF of the paper and any slide decks.
- `design/` – short design and milestone notes.
- `data/` – synthetic interaction logs and user-level panels (no real data).
- `analysis/` – analysis scripts / notebooks using the synthetic data.
- `figures/` – diagrams such as the CEA flow figure.

All datasets here are **fully synthetic and generated for illustration only**.

## Version 1 artefact status

Release **v1.5.0** freezes the first synthetic artefact package for this concept paper.
It includes:

- CEA paper PDF (`docs/Consent_Explanation_Appeals_AIMediatedServices_v1.pdf`)
- Flow figure (`figures/cea_flow.pdf`)
- Synthetic interaction logs and user panels (`data/`)
- Simple analysis and merge scripts (`analysis/`)
- Design + milestone notes (`design/`)

These materials are suitable for sharing as a transparency / reproducibility
companion, while containing no real user data.
