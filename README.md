# Consent, Explanation, and Appeals in AI-Mediated Services

This repository contains **synthetic** data, analysis scripts, and materials for the
concept paper:

> "Consent, Explanation, and Appeals in AI-Mediated Services: Designing for
> Understanding, Fairness, and Recourse" (Akshaya Jayasankar, 2025).

The goal is to prototype an **evidence-ready evaluation pipeline** for an
AI-mediated benefits-eligibility service, using only synthetic logs.

## Repository structure

- `docs/` – PDF of the paper and any slide decks.
- `design/` – short design and milestone notes.
- `data/` – synthetic interaction logs and user-level panels (no real data).
- `analysis/` – analysis scripts / notebooks using the synthetic data.
- `figures/` – diagrams such as the CEA flow figure.

All datasets here are **fully synthetic and generated for illustration only**.
